# NOTES ðŸ“‹
- This is a very basic written script and it's not protected from glitches so I'll update it few times every week

- **Also DO NOT write issues that claim that my program is infected and malicious, I encrypted the code to protect it from skids**

- Don't steal or modify and repost my code I left watermarks on it I will catch you ðŸŽ¯
